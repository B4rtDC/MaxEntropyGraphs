# MaxEntropyGraphs
The goal of the *MaxEntropyGraphs.jl* package is to group the various maximum-entropy null models for network randomization and make them available to the Julia community in a single package. This work was in part inspired by the [Maximum Entropy Hub](https://meh.imtlucca.it), but unlike the latter, this package works in an integrated way with the exisiting Julia ecosystem for handling graphs, optimization tools and numerical solvers and groups all models in a single framework.

The package provides the following functionalities:
* Computing the likelihood maximizing parameters for a broad set of network models (cf. `Models` section of the documentation).
* Sampling of networks from a network ensemble once the parameters have been computed.
* Analytically computing ensemble averages and their standard deviations (for a subset of models).
* Running motif based analysis (for a subset of models).
* Bipartite network projections with statistical significance analysis (for a subset of models).

Each network models can be solved in different ways, with a fixed-point method typically being the fastest and a Newton-based method being the slowest. Depending on the complexity of the network model, some solvers might not always converge.

## Installation
Assuming that you already have Julia correctly installed, installation is straightforward. 
It suffices to import MaxEntropyGraphs.jl in the standard way:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("MaxEntropyGraphs")
```
or enter the Pkg mode by hitting ```]```, and then run the following command:
```Julia
pkg> add MaxEntropyGraphs
```

## Example usage
More detailed information is available in the documentation and some demos are available in the examples subfolder.
```julia
using Graphs
using MaxEntropyGraphs
# generate a simple graph
G = smallgraph(:karate)
# generate a model
model = UBCM(G)
# solve the model
solve_model!(model)
# generate 100 random instances from the ensemble
G_sample = rand(model, 100)
```

## Citing


## Available models
`MaxEntropyGraphs.jl` is intended to do *network randomization*. The specific kind of network to randomize and the properties to preserve defines the model you need. 
Details for each of the available models can be found in the [Models](./models.html) section. 
Sometimes multiple models might be applicable. In that case, you can use information theory-based metrics to help make an informed decision. 
The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) are available to quantify this.
Lower BIC or AIC values indicate a better model fit, considering the trade-off between complexity and fit.
